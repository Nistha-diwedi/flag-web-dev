The Indian flag, fondly called the Tiranga ( tricolor), is a beautiful and symbolic representation of the nation :

Design:
The flag is a horizontal tricolour of three equal bands:
India saffron (kesari) at the top, signifying courage and sacrifice.
White in the middle, representing peace and truth.
India green at the bottom, symbolizing fertility, growth, and auspiciousness.
In the center of the white band is a navy blue Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel. The chakra is an ancient symbol of Dharma (righteousness) and progress. It is taken from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka, a Mauryan era sculpture.

The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 2:3.

History:
The flag was adopted in its present form on July 22, 1947, just 24 days before India's independence.
Pingali Venkayya, a teacher and freedom fighter, is credited with designing the flag. He submitted several designs to a committee set up by the Indian National Congress in 1931.
The flag was initially designed with a spinning wheel in the center, but it was later replaced with the Ashoka Chakra.
The flag has undergone a few minor changes over the years, but its overall design has remained the same.
